# cra-template-ivory

This is the official @ivoryio template 

It could be used with create-react-app, but it's meant to be used by the [ivory-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ivoryio/ivory-cli) with `ivory create`

What this template has to offer:
* infrastructure-as-code for creating a AWS Codecommit repo and an Amplify app (which offers CI/CD and hosting)
* e2e tests with cypress
* components and a customizable theme using material-ui and styled-components
* an intuitive folder structure
* support for aliases
* everything in typescript
* more to follow
